I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
<<<<<<< HEAD

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
